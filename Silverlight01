Within Canvas you do mention that StoryBoard as follows:

<Canvas.Resources>
<Storyboard x:Name="canTabStoryboard">
<DoubleAnimation x:Name="daCanTabStoryboard" Storyboard.TargetProperty="(Canvas.Left)" Storyboard.TargetName="spShowcase" Duration="0:0:01"/>
</Storyboard>
</Canvas.Resources>

in C# - code behind

You can start the storyboart with

canTabStoryboard.Begin();

and move that using the following sample code as

daCanTabStoryboard.From = pointStart;
daCanTabStoryboard.To = pointEnd;
